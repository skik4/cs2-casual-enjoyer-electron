# CS2 Casual Enjoyer

**CS2 Casual Enjoyer** is an Electron-based desktop application that automates the process of joining a friend's Casual match in Counter-Strike 2 (CS2). Steam does not provide a built-in feature for this in CS2, and the Steam client may show outdated or delayed information about available slots in a match. This app helps you connect to your friend's Casual game as soon as a slot becomes available, improving your experience and saving time.

## How It Works

- The app uses Steam Web API requests to monitor your friend's match status.
- You can use either a Steam API key or a session token (recommended) for authentication.
- Tokens are valid for 24 hours and are obtained by redirecting you to the installed Steam client on your computer.
- The app notifies you and can automate the connection process as soon as a slot is detected in your friend's match.

## How to Run

The easiest way to use the application is to download the prebuilt `.exe` from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/skik4/cs2-casual-enjoyer-electron/releases) page and run it directly.  
No installation of Node.js or other dependencies is required.

## How to Use

After the first launch, click on the label **"Steam Web API Token / Key"** in the application.  
A detailed instruction will be shown on how to obtain your Steam API token or key.
